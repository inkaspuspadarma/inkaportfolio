## 🌟 About the Project

Hi! I'm **Inka Sharatu Puspadarma**, an Information Systems graduate with a passion for bridging the gap between humans and technology through thoughtful design, impactful systems, and data-driven decision making.

This portfolio website is a living archive of my projects, experiences, and capabilities. I built it to better tell my story — not just as a resume, but as a reflection of how I think, work, and solve problems in the digital space.

## 💼 Why I Built This

I believe your portfolio should reflect not only *what* you’ve done, but *how* you think. I built this website because:

- I wanted a **central place to share** everything I’ve worked on and learned.
- I enjoy building things from scratch — especially when it challenges me to grow.
- I wanted full control over my **personal brand** and online presence.

> Every section, style choice, and line of code here is intentional.
